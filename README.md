# SimplePaint

A simple Windows paint application for coloring coloring pages.

A friend who works with severly handicapped children approached me in regards to a simple paint application better suited for an eye gaze system. This meant bigger buttons and minimalised functionality. The application was developed specifically for this student. They use it to "paint" worksheets.

## How To Use SimplePaint

After launching the application, you'll want to load an image. Once the image is loaded, you can select the bucket or text tool and start painting. When you save, you will be prompted for a filename. You can certainly save over the original, or save it as a new file. From then on, saving will save over whatever filename you specified.

The following file formats are supported: .png, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp

### Installing

Download Binaries/SimplePaint.UI.exe and run. That's it.
